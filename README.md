# OnlineStore

The OnlineStore is a web-based clothing store where customers can browse and purchase different clothing items for the family. 

This project is important as it affords customers the flexibility to visit the shop and buy their favourite apparel at their convenient time and from anywhere in the world as long as they are connected to the internet. 

The OnlineStore allows the customer to browse various departments within the store. It also allows the customer to add items to the shopping cart, receive discounts and choose to collect the order or to have the order delivered.
